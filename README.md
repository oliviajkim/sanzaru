###Objectives + Goals of Project
Sanzaru is releasing a new game February 16, 2016. Prior to that release date, Sanzaru wants a new website following the current web trends and to be more attractive to potential  candidates that may be interested in working for the company. 

The current website has too many colors and is not responsive as well as being outdated. 

Because the company is currently expanding their work space and anticipate huge growth, one goal is to highlight the careers and jobs page highlighting benefits for future employees.
